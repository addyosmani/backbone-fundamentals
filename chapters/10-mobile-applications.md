# Mobile Applications

## Backbone & jQuery Mobile

### Resolving the routing conflicts

The first major hurdle developers typically run into when building Backbone applications with jQuery Mobile is that both frameworks have their own opinions about how to handle application navigation.

Backbone's routers offer an explicit way to define custom navigation routes through `Backbone.Router`, whilst jQuery Mobile encourages the use of URL hash fragments to reference separate 'pages' or views in the same document. jQuery Mobile also supports automatically pulling in external content for links through XHR calls meaning that there can be quite a lot of inter-framework confusion about what a link pointing at '#photo/id' should actually be doing.

Some of the solutions that have been previously proposed to work-around this problem included manually patching Backbone or jQuery Mobile. I discourage opting for these techniques as it becomes necessary to manually patch your framework builds when new releases get made upstream.

There's also [jQueryMobile router](https://github.com/azicchetti/jquerymobile-router), which tries to solve this problem differently, however I think my proposed solution is both simpler and allows both frameworks to cohabit quite peacefully without the need to extend either. What we're after is a way to prevent one framework from listening to hash changes so that we can fully rely on the other (e.g. `Backbone.Router`) to handle this for us exclusively.

Using jQuery Mobile this can be done by setting:

```javascript
$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false;
```

prior to initializing any of your other code.

I discovered this method looking through some jQuery Mobile commits that didn't make their way into the official docs, but am happy to see that they are now [covered in more detail](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html).

The next question that arises is, if we're preventing jQuery Mobile from listening to URL hash changes, how can we still get the benefit of being able to navigate to other sections in a document using the built-in transitions and effects supported? Good question. This can be solved by simply calling `$.mobile.changePage()` as follows:

```javascript
var url = '#about',
    effect = 'slideup',
    reverse = false,
    changeHash = false;

$.mobile.changePage( url , { transition: effect}, reverse, changeHash );
```

In the above sample, `url` can refer to a URL or a hash identifier to navigate to, `effect` is simply the transition effect to animate the page in with and the final two parameters decide the direction for the transition (`reverse`) and whether or not the hash in the address bar should be updated (`changeHash`). With respect to the latter, I typically set this to false to avoid managing two sources for hash updates, but feel free to set this to true if you're comfortable doing so.

### Exercise: A Backbone, Require.js/AMD app with jQuery Mobile

**Note:** The code for this exercise can be found in `practicals/modular-mobile-app`.

### Getting started

Once you feel comfortable with the [Backbone fundamentals](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/hh377172.aspx) and you've put together a rough wireframe of the app you may wish to build, start to think about your application architecture. Ideally, you'll want to logically separate concerns so that it's as easy as possible to maintain the app in the future.

**Namespacing**

For this application, I opted for the nested namespacing pattern. Implemented correctly, this enables you to clearly identify if items being referenced in your app are views, other modules and so on. This initial structure is a sane place to also include application defaults (unless you prefer maintaining those in a separate file).

```javascript
window.mobileSearch = window.mobileSearch || {
    views: {
        appview: new AppView()
    },
    routers:{
        workspace:new Workspace()
    },
    utils: utils,
    defaults: {
        resultsPerPage: 16,
        safeSearch: 2,
        maxDate:'',
        minDate:'01/01/1970'
    }
}
```

**Models**

In the Flickly application, there are at least two unique types of data that need to be modeled - search results and individual photos, both of which contain additional meta-data like photo titles. If you simplify this down, search results are actually groups of photos in their own right, so the application only requires:

* A single model (a photo or 'result' entry)
* A result collection (containing a group of result entries) for search results
* A photo collection (containing one or more result entries) for individual photos or photos with more than one image

**Views**

The views we'll need include an application view, a search results view and a photo view. Static views or pages of the single-page application which do not require a dynamic element for them (e.g an 'about' page) can be easily coded up in your document's markup, independent of Backbone.

**Routers**

A number of possible routes need to be taken into consideration:

* Basic search queries `#search/kiwis`
* Search queries with additional parameters (e.g sort, pagination) `#search/kiwis/srelevance/p7`
* Queries for specific photos `#photo/93839`
* A default route (no parameters passed)


This tutorial will be expanded shortly to fully cover the demo application. In the mean time, please see the practicals folder for the completed application that demonstrates the router resolution discussed earlier between Backbone and jQuery Mobile.


### jQuery Mobile: Going beyond mobile application development

The majority of jQM apps I've seen in production have been developed for the purpose of providing an optimal experience to users on mobile devices. Given that the framework was developed for this purpose, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this, but many developers forget that jQM is a UI framework not dissimilar to jQuery UI. It's using the widget factory and is capable of being used for a lot more than we give it credit for.

If you open up Flickly in a desktop browser, you'll get an image search UI that's modeled on Google.com, however, review the components (buttons, text inputs, tabs) on the page for a moment. The desktop UI doesn't look anything like a mobile application yet I'm still using jQM for theming mobile components; the tabs, date-picker, sliders - everything in the desktop UI is re-using what jQM would be providing users on mobile devices. Thanks to some media queries, the desktop UI can make optimal use of whitespace, expanding component blocks out and providing alternative layouts whilst still making use of jQM as a component framework.

The benefit of this is that I don't need to go pulling in jQuery UI separately to be able to take advantage of these features. Thanks to the recent ThemeRoller my components can look pretty much exactly how I would like them to and users of the app can get a jQM UI for lower-resolutions and a jQM-ish UI for everything else.

The takeaway here is just to remember that if you're not (already) going through the hassle of conditional script/style loading based on screen-resolution (using matchMedia.js etc), there are simpler approaches that can be taken to cross-device component theming.
