## Prelude

![](img/logo.jpg)

How do you write an organized, maintainable application with JavaScript? This book helps you answer this question with a walkthrough of the [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) library for structuring web applications.

Begin with the fundamentals, work your way through the internals, practicals and finally learn how to build on top of what Backbone.js has to offer. If you are a developer looking to write code that can be more easily read, structured and extended - this guide is ideal for you.

I hope you find this book helpful!


## Target Audience

This book is targeted at novice to intermediate developers wishing to learn how to better structure their client-side code. An understanding of JavaScript fundamentals is required to get the most out of it, however we have tried to provide a basic description of these concepts where possible.

## Reading

I assume your level of knowledge about JavaScript goes beyond the basics and as such certain topics such as object literals are skipped. If you need to learn more about the language, I am happy to suggest:
