  "readme": "# grunt-release\n[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) plugin for automating all the release steps of your node lib or bower component, with optional publishing to npm.  \n\n## Repetition Killed the Cat\nReleasing a new version of your killer Node lib looks like this:\n\n1. bump the version in your `package.json` file.\n2. stage the package.json file's change.\n3. commit that change with a message like \"release 0.6.22\".\n4. create a new git tag for the release. \n5. push the changes out to github.\n6. also push the new tag out to github.\n7. publish the new version to npm.\n\nCool, right? No! What's wrong with you? Automate all that:\n\n```shell\ngrunt release\n```\n\nDone. No more github issues reminding you how often you forget to do one or more of the steps.\n\n## Setup\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-release --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-release');\n```\n\n## Using grunt-release\n\n**Patch Release:**\n```shell\ngrunt release\n```\nor\n```shell\ngrunt release:patch\n```\n\n**Minor Release:**\n```shell\ngrunt release:minor\n```\n\n**Major Release:**\n```shell\ngrunt release:major\n```\n\n## Options\nYou can disable any of the steps if you want, by adding this to your Gruntfile:\n\n```js\n  release: {\n    options: {\n      bump: false, //default: true\n      file: 'component.json', //default: package.json\n      add: false, //default: true\n      commit: false, //default: true\n      tag: false, //default: true\n      push: false, //default: true\n      pushTags: false, //default: true\n      npm: false //default: true\n    }\n  }\n```\nFor node libs, leave `file` option blank. For bower components, set it to `component.json` or whatever you've set your bower config file to be.\n\n## Credits\nInspired by Vojta Jina's [grunt-bump](https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump).\n\n## License\nMIT",
