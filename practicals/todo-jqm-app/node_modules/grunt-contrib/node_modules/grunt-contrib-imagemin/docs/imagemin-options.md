Type: `Number`  
Default: `0`

Select optimization level between `0` and `7`.

> The optimization level 0 enables a set of optimization operations that require minimal effort. There will be no changes to image attributes like bit depth or color type, and no recompression of existing IDAT datastreams. The optimization level 1 enables a single IDAT compression trial.
